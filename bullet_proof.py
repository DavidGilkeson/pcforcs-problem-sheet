# Write a (bullet proof) function called averageTo(aList, toIndex)

# The function should take in a list and an index. 

# The function will return the average of the numbers up to and including the toIndex in the aList.

# When I say "bullet proof", I would like the function to always return an integer, even if a error occurs (say return -1), but it will use logging to make a meaningful log warning, for any error that occurs (eg the aList contains an entry that is not a number/ toIndex is not valid, there are many things that could go wrong)

# Write the code to test all the things that could go wrong with this function, and a test to check the function does work.

# The test code can be in the same file or different file.
