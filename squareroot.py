# Write a program that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.

# You should create a function called <tt>sqrt</tt> that does this.
# I am asking you to create your own sqrt function and not to use the built in functions x ** .5 or math.sqrt(x)
# I suggest that you look at the newton method at estimating square roots

# Please enter a positive number: 14.5
# The square root of 14.5 is approx. 3.8.

number = abs(float(input("Please enter a positive number: "))) # Takes positive number from the user, stores it in a variable called number and converts it to a float. abs makes sure it is a positive number.
print(number)

# def sqrt():
